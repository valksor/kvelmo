# kvelmo implement

Execute the specification and make code changes.

## Usage

```bash
kvelmo implement
```

## Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--force` | Re-run even if already implemented |

## Prerequisites

- Task must be in `planned` state
- Run `kvelmo plan` first

## Examples

```bash
# Execute specification
kvelmo implement

# Force re-implement
kvelmo implement --force
```

## What Happens

1. Agent reads the specification
2. Agent modifies code files
3. Agent may run tests
4. A git checkpoint is created
5. State transitions to `implemented`

## Watching Progress

The agent's work streams in real-time:
- Files being read and modified
- Code changes being made
- Tool calls (writes, terminal commands)

## Optional Post-Processing

After implementation, you can optionally run:

```bash
# Simplify code for clarity
kvelmo simplify

# Optimize code quality
kvelmo optimize
```

## If Implementation Fails

Use undo to revert:
```bash
kvelmo undo
```

Then adjust the specification or task description.
