# kvelmo optimize

Optional: Optimize code quality after implementation.

## Usage

```bash
kvelmo optimize
```

## Prerequisites

- Task must be in `implemented` state

## What Happens

1. Agent reviews the implemented code
2. Optimizes for performance and quality
3. Creates a checkpoint
4. Returns to `implemented` state

## Examples

```bash
kvelmo implement
kvelmo optimize  # Optional optimization
kvelmo review
```

## When to Use

- Code is correct but slow
- Want performance improvements
- Need better algorithms
